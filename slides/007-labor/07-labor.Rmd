# Urban labor markets

_Why care about labor markets in urban economics?_

--

David Card: 
> A city _is_ a labor market

--

Cities provide incentives for firms and workers to locate close to each other

Density of a city is generated entirely by incentives in the labor market

--

<br>

.hi[Q:] Modeling .hii[individual] location decisions, what should we consider?

---
# Urban labor markets

_What are the most important features in location decisions?_

--
.pull-left[
- Wages
- Rents
- Amenities (catch all)]

--
.pull-right[
- Birthplace
- Distance to birthplace]

--

.hii[Wages] are significant factor of individual/household location choices

.hi[Imagine] if Amazon/Google/Microsoft opens a campus in Portland
  
--

  - What would happen to rents? Gentrification? Commute times?
  
--

<br>

Introducing large amounts of .hi[high paying jobs] + .hi-red[capital] changes a city

---
# Urban labor markets

.hi[A labor market consists of:]

.hi[(i).] Firms that buy labor. Generate labor demand 

.hi[(ii).] HH's who sell labor. Generate labor supply

--

.hi-blue[Labor] and .hii[urban] economist model labor markets (supply) differently

--

.hi-blue[Labor:] Discuss labor supply as being generated from labor-leisure trade off

  - Model: Rational agents making optimal choices over leisure/education

--

.hii[Urban:] Discuss labor supply as being generated from _location choices_
  
  - Assume people work fixed hours but choose where to work

# Labor demand

Both fields generally model .hi[Labor demand] similarly

--

.hi[Definition: Labor Demand]
- Set of quantities of labor demanded corresponding to a _set_ of wages
  
--
 
.hi[Q:] What's the difference between changes in:
.pull-left[
- _labor demand_]
.pull-right[
- _quantity of labor demanded_]

--

$\Delta$ Labor demand: Shift in the demand curve

$\Delta$ Quantity of labor demanded: Movement along a demand curve

---
# Labor demand

We will start with the .hi[competitive] model:

--

.ul[.hi[Assumptions:]]

.hii[(i).] Firms seek to maximize profits

--

.hii[(ii).] Markets are perfectly competitive (in .hii[both] inputs and output)

--

$\Rightarrow$ No individual firm can influence the price of labor (or other inputs)
  
$\Rightarrow$ No individual firm can influence the output price

---
# Labor demand

Derive a condition for EQ labor the firm will hire in the competitive model?

\begin{align*}
\pi &= P*Q - TC 
\end{align*}

---
# Labor demand

Derive a condition for EQ labor the firm will hire in the competitive model?

\begin{align*}
\pi &= P*Q - TC\\
\pi &= \underbrace{P*F(L,K)}_\text{TR} - \underbrace{w*L-r*K}_{\text{TC}}
\end{align*}

where:

--

 - $P$: Output price
 
 - $F(L,K) = Q$: Quantity produced (function of labor and capital)
 
  - $Q = F(L,K)$
  
--

 - $w$: Wage rate; $L$: total labor employed $\Rightarrow w*L =$ cost of labor
 - $r$: rental rate; $K$: capital $\Rightarrow r*K =$ cost of capital 

---
# Labor demand

.hi[Claim]: Firm hires labor .hi[if and only if] _marginal profit_ w.r.t to labor is positive. 

--

.hi[.ul[Definition:] Marginal Profit w.r.t to labor] ( $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L}$ )

  - The change in profit from hiring an additional unit of labor

--

.hi["Proof":] (Too many cooks)

- If $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} <0$, added profit from an additional unit of labor is negative (ie. a loss), so the firm _should not_ hire the next unit

--

- If $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} > 0$, added profit from an additional unit of labor is positive (ie. a gain), so the firm _should_ hire the next unit

--

- If $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} = 0$ Optimal allocation for the firm. Can't do better

---
# Labor demand

.hi[Definitions:]

- .hi[Marginal Product of Labor:] Change in output from an additional unit of labor employed

--

  - $MP_L = \frac{\Delta F(L,K)}{\Delta L}$

--

- .hi[Marginal Revenue Product of Labor:] Value of the change in output from an additional unit of labor employed

--

  -  $MRP_L = P*\frac{\Delta F(L,K)}{\Delta L}$

---
# Labor demand

So what is $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L}$?

--

\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} = P*\frac{\Delta F(L,K)}{\Delta L} - w*\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta L}  
\end{align*}

---
# Labor demand

So what is $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L}$?

\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} &= P*\frac{\Delta F(L,K)}{\Delta L} - w*\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta L} \\
&= P*MP_L - w\\
& = MRP_L - w
\end{align*}

--

Now, set $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L}=0$ to get the labor demand curve:

\begin{align*}
 MRP_L - w =0 \implies MRP_L = w
\end{align*}

# Labor demand

_Why might .hi[labor demand] curves vary across cities?_

--

.hi[(i).] Differences in productivity across cities (agglomeration)

--

.hi[(ii).] Variation in (business) taxes across cities

--

.hi[(iii).] Industrial public service infastructure (electricity, water, gas pipelines)

--

.hi[(iv).] Land use policies
  - stricter zoning $\implies$ higher land price $\implies$ less money for other inputs

--

.hi[(v).] Demand for a city's exported goods

# Labor Supply

A _set_ of quantities of labor supplied corresponding to a _set_ of wages. 

.hi[q:] What causes _movement along_ the labor supply curve?

--

- A change in wages. That's it!

--

<br>

.hi[q:] What causes a _shift_ of the labor supply curve?

--

- Changes in amenities (building of a nicer school, eroding of air quality)

- Changes in residential government expenditures (increase in taxes drives people away, increases in govt spending brings people in)

---
# Labor Supply

Knowing how responsive workers are to changes in wages is key for vast swaths of policies

- Estimates for labor supply elasticities are pretty big

- If $\varepsilon_{\text{workforce},\text{wage}} = 2$, what does this mean?

--

.hi[In general] estimated labor supply elasticities are higher for workers with a college degree than without a college degree. What does this mean?

--

  - College educated individuals are more responsive to changes in wages w.r.t to their location decisions



---
# Labor Supply Example


```{R, labor_supply, echo=F,fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, dev = "svg", cache=T}

labor_supply <- function(x) 5+x

# Equilibrium

---
#Equilibrium 

__Defn__

  - A .hi[labor market equilibrium] is a pair of points $(L^*, W^*)$ such that:
  
    - labor supply = labor demand

  - IE: a labor market eq is where there is no excess supply or demand
  
--

We usually think of cities as being "separate" labor markets, so the equilibria can be different across cities

--

# Competitive labor markets

# Characteristics of a competitive market

To start we will look at an extreme market structure

--

.ul[.hi[Competitive labor market:]] Industry structure in which their are many workers supplying (homogeneous) labor to many firms 

.hi[(i).] Many potential buyers and sellers of labor

.hi[(ii).] Labor is homogeneous; same human capital across workers

.hi[(iii).] Perfect information; workers know the going wage $w$

.hi[(iv).] Firms take wages as given; no incentive to offer above or below $w^*$

.hi[(v).] No barriers to entry/exit; $\Pi \rightarrow 0$

---
# Competitive model: Example

.hi[Recall our assumptions for the competitive model:]

.hii[(i).] Firms seek to maximize profits

--

.hii[(ii).] Markets are perfectly competitive (in .orange[both] inputs and output)

--

Suppose we have the following linear $L_D$ and $L_S$ curves:

\begin{align*}
W_D &= 40 - 5L_D \\
W_S &= 5 + 2L_S
\end{align*}

Solve for equilibrium $W^*, L^*$


---
# Competitive model: Example

\begin{align*}
W_D &= 40 - 5L_D \\
W_S &= 5 + 2L_S
\end{align*}

--

```{R, comp_eq, echo=F,fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, dev = "svg", cache=T}

ld <- function(x)  40 - 5*x
ls <- function(x)  5 + 2*x

# Competitive model

We built up labor .hi[supply] and .hi[demand]. Where do these come from?
- Firms demand and households supply

--

Recall our result about labor demand from earlier:

.center[.hii[A firm will hire labor until labor costs (wage) exactly offsets the marginal revenue product of labor]]

--

Summing each firm's $MRP_L$ curve across the entire market generates the market labor demand curve

---
# Competitive model

Perfectly competitive markets are not super realistic; .hii[extreme] outcome

--

Labor market structures share many of the .hi[same characteristics]

--

Understanding the .hii[extreme outcomes] inform us of the spectrum of labor markets in between

<br>

--

Perfectly competitive is one extreme; what is the market structure on the other side of the spectrum?

# Monopsony

So what are the main consequence(s) of .hi[monopsony]?

.center[.hi[Monopsonists have the ability to pay a wage below the marginal value]]

--

The consequences?

--

- .hi[Higher profit] for the firms

- Deadweight loss; inefficient outcomes (ie less surplus)

--

<br>

Lets formalize monopsonies in a labor market model

--

.hi[Recall:] In the competive model, the firm pays the worker $w = MRP_l$. 

--

- Is this what the monopsonist would do?

---
# Monopsony

Competitve model: Firms seek to maximize profits but can't influence wages

--

The competitive firm hires labor until the marginal profit w.r.t to labor is zero
  
\begin{align*}
\pi &= TR - TC\\
\pi &= TR - wL - rK
\end{align*}

Profit maxing cond: $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} = 0 \implies MRP_L -w = 0 \implies w = MRP_L$


---
# Monopsony: Formalizing the Result

Monopsonist can influence wages by the amount of labor they hire 

--

Now

\begin{align*}
\pi &= TR - w(L)L - rK
\end{align*}

--

where $w(L)$ is an .pink[increasing function] of the .pink[amount of labor hired]

--

Firm will hire labor until marginal cost is equalized to marginal benefit
  
  - or: _.pink[marginal profit] wrt labor_ is equal to zero
  
\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} =0 
\end{align*}

---
# Monopsony: Formalizing the Result

Notation: $TC(L) =w(L)*L$ is the TC from labor in monopsony

\begin{align*}
\pi &= TR - TC(L) - rK
\end{align*}

--

Profit Maximization:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} &=0
\end{align*}

# Monopsony: Formalizing the Result

Profit Maximization:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} &=0\\
MRP_L &- \frac{\Delta TC(L)}{\Delta L} = 0\\
\end{align*}

# Monopsony: Formalizing the Result

Notation: $TC(L) =w(L)*L$ is the TC from labor in monopsony

Profit Maximization:

\begin{align*}

So the monoposonist hires until:

\begin{align*}

\end{align*}

.hi[Important:] In the competitive model, marginal cost of labor was constant (equal to wage)

Monopsony: Marginal cost is increasing because monopsonist is the _only_ buyer

# Minimum wage

Minimum wages are a form of .hi[price controls]. 

Specifically, a minimum wage is a .hi[price floor]

- .hi[Price floor:] Dictates the .hii[minimum] allowed price for transactions in a marketplace

--

A price floor is .hi[binding] if it has an impact on the market equilibrium

--

A price floor that is below the market price is .hii[nonbinding]

#Significance?

__2 Questions__


- Why do we care so much about modeling cities as different labor markets? .hi.purple[Discuss]

- Do you think all labor markets across cities and industries are competitive? .hi.purple[Discuss]

# Some Notes

- All else equal, low tax cities grow faster than high tax cities


  - Elasticity (business activity, taxes)
  
--

  - Across cities: -0.1 to -0.6
  
  -  Within cities: -1.0 to -3.0

--

 - Manufacturers are more sensitive to tax differences

# Monopsony and Minimum Wage

- So we saw the .pink[monopsonist] outcome leads to .hi[lower employment and wages] than the .pink[competitive outcome].


--

- In perfect competition, what happens to unemployment with a minimum wage?

--

- Is it the same with a monopsony? No!


---
# Minimum wage: Example

Let's compare the effect of a minimum wage on both market structures:
- Competitive market
- Monopsony

--

Suppose we have two cites (A and B). City A follows the following $L_D$ and $L_S$

\begin{align*}
W_D^A &= 25 - 5 \cdot L_D^A \\
W_S^A &= 3 +3 \cdot L_S^A \\
\end{align*}

And city B follows the following $L_D$ and $L_S$

\begin{align*}
W_D^A &= 25 - L_D^A \\
W_S^A &= 1 + 3 \cdot L_S^A \\
\end{align*}
