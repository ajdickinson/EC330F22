# Congestion Externalities

MEC from congestion = $m\cdot v\cdot c$ where
- $m$ is the additional time in traffic from an extra vehicle on the road
- $v$ is the number of other road users
- $c$ is the opportunity cost of time

--

.hi[Note:] When there are few cares on the road, $m$ and $v$ are relatively small
- As the number of cars increases, MEC increases (it is nonlinear)
- Also: the above formula makes a strong assumption, what is it?

# Congestion

_How do we fix .hi[Congestion]?_

--

_What is the popular answer?_
--
 .hi[Build more roads]

--
  
If you build more
- more space for cars allowing congestion will decrease

--

_What assumption must we make when stating:_

.center[_"building roads will reduce congestion"_]

--

.hi[A:] The number of drivers will remain the same after the road is built

---
class: clear

# Congestion

Think of the .hi[incentives] of drivers

--

.hi[(i)] People avoid driving because it is costly
- time, gas, maintenance costs

--

.hi[(ii)] Building a new road makes it less costly
- time costs reduce

--

.hi[(iii)] On the .hi[margin], people will start to drive when the new road is built

--

.hi[Fundamental law of highway congestion:] 

> When you expand highways, more drivers will substitute toward the new lane

# Externalities

Generally when facing .hi-red[negative externalities], there exist .hi[two avenues] to reduce private consumption

.hii[(i)] Quotas

> Set minimum or maximum level of activity allowed

# Congestion

If building more roads is not a great solution...

--

and self-driving cars are not viable...

--

.hi[Pigouvian taxes] are an excellent alternative

--

.hi[Main insight:] 

The social cost of driving exceeds private cost

So how can we raise the MPC such that $MPC = MSC$

--

_How can we do this?_
--
 .hi[Tax them.]

--

- Pigouvian tax specific to reducing road congestion is .hi[congestion pricing]

# Externalities: Pigouvian taxes

Many cities across the globe have enacted or are planning to enact congestion pricing

.pull-left[
- London
- Singapore
- Milan]
.pull-right[
- Stockholm
- Bejing
- NYC, LA, SF (coming soon)
]

--

.hi[Results:]

Following enactment of congestion pricing in London:

- Traffic was reduced by 15%
- Reduced travel times in the city by 30%

# Peak vs. Off Period Taxes


---
# Mechanisms

Model demonstrated congestion taxes reduce traffic volume. How?

--

.hi[(i)] Modal substition: switch to carpool, public transit

--

.hi[(ii)] Switch to off-peak travel

--

.hi[(ii)] Switch route

--

.hi[(iv)] Location decisions: change residence or workplace


---
# Discussion

Congestion taxes sound like a good idea, right? What are the problems?

--

- Roads aren't always congested. So tax needs to be time-varying. Gets very complicated

- Are all autos charged the same amount (semis and prius?)
