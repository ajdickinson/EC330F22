# Housing markets

---
# Housing markets 

Distinguish the following two markets:
- .hi[Rental Market:] Supply and Demand for rentals
- .hii[Housing Market:] Supply and Demand for houses

<br>

--

<br>

_Why is it important to distinguish these?_
 - A house is an asset. A month of rent is not
 - Homeowners are much less mobile than renters
  
  
---
# Homeownership

Following the great depression the .hi[New Deal] stimulated private homeownership by making it easier for individuals to buy and sell houses
- established the .hi[Federal Housing Administration] and the .hi[Home Owners Loan Corporation]

--

The Federal Government .hi[invented] the modern home mortgage by .hii[insuring] private home loans

Which .hi[incentivised] banks to accept:
- .hi-red[smaller] down payments
- .hi-red[lower] interest rates
- .hi-blue[longer] term loans (15/30 year mortgage) 

--

Allowed citizens to buy homes that they otherwise would not have afforded, establishing cycles of .hi[generational wealth]


---
# Homeownership

_Why is buying a home different than buying a pair of jeans?_

--

Houses are a major investment and store of value (.hi[equity])

--

Homeownership remains a .hi[key] component of household wealth
- The value is subject to some uncertainty
 
--

<br>
 
Purchasing a home is a .hi[dynamic] (forward-looking) decision

Jeans (a pure consumption good) is not really a store of value

--

We will focus on the rental  market.
--
 But first some data.

.center[.hi[What caused the housing market crash in 2007?]]

--

.center[.hii[Among many other things, subprime mortgages]]

--

Historically, mortgage loans were a safe investment as defaulting was rare

--

Mortgages are typically bundled together with lots of other home loans and sold on a marketplace better banks

--

Due to growing home prices in the US housing market, these ".hi[securities]" were desirable and had higher returns than US treasury bonds and were in high demand. Lenders tried to keep up.

--

Mortgage lenders took too much risk by extending loans the millions of Americans who could not afford them

---
# Housing crisis (summarized)

These high risk, subprime loans were bundled into .hi[securities] with lower risk loans and sold them to banks

--

Rating agencies didn't fully understand the extent to which lenders were extending subprime loans and granted high grades (AAA)

--

Then the housing bubble popped, and high interest rates set in on adjustable loans, massive amounts of people defaulted

--

People shorted the banks on their investments and it lead to a massive financial crisis

# Rental markets

---
# Rental market model

Just like labor markets, each city has its own market for rental units 
- Consists of suppliers (absentee landlords) 
- Individuals making optimal housing demand decisions

--

.hi[Important:] Firms (landlords) supply housing to households

--

.hi[Assumptions:]

--

.hii[(i)] No individual landlord can influence the price of rents

--

.hii[(ii)] Landlords decide how much housing to provide

--

.hii[(iii)] The amount of housing they provide will again come from profit maximization


---

# Rental market model: Monopoly

Now let's consider the .hi[monopoly] situation:

--

.hi[Assume:]

--

.hii[(i)] One seller of the good (rental units)

--

.hii[(ii)] The monopolist has market power; ability to set prices

--

.hii[(iii)] The monopolist is a profit maximizer

---
# Rental market model: Monopoly

Equilibrium relies on the assumption that firms maximize profits

--

Now TR is a function of quantity

\begin{equation*}
TR = P(Q)*Q
\end{equation*}

--

Quantity of houses that the monopolist produces changes the market price

--

$P(Q)$ in this context is called the inverse demand function
  
--

.hi[Profit is given by:]

\begin{align*}
\pi(Q) = P(Q)*Q - TC(Q)
\end{align*}

\frac{\Delta P(Q)*Q}{\Delta Q} - \frac{\Delta TC(Q)}{\Delta Q} = 0

# Rental markets across cities

---
# Rents across cities

.hi[Key question:] What causes rental curves to vary across cities?

--
  
Supply curves across cities are impacted by:
- .hi-blue[local construction costs]
- .hi-green[limited land availability] (for development)
- .hi-green[land-use regulations]

--

.hi-blue[Local construction costs]: shifts supply curve (labor is more expensive for all firms in one area vs another)

--

.hi-green[Land availability] + .hi-green[land use regulations:] rotates supply curve (changes in the marginal cost of developing land)

---
# Rents across cities

_Why do changes in local constructions costs shift the supply curve when land use regulations rotate it?_

--

.hi[Answer:] 

Changes in .hi-blue[construction costs] impact all development equally.
- if wood becomes more expensive then every project becomes equally more expensive across the city

Changes in .hi-green[land availability] or .hi-green[land-use regulations] increase the .hii[opportunity cost] of developing additional plots of land
- prices bid faster for each additional development

# Rent Control in Oregon

### Senate Bill 608

2019: Oregon passes .hi[state-wide] rent control 
- limits annual increases to inflation (2-3%) + 7%
- landlords can increase rent without limit for new tenants

--

Also includes a series of eviction protections for renters

# Land use restrictions

---
# Land use restrictions

Land use restrictions limit what one can do with available land. 

--

Examples:

.hi[(i)] Density restrictions

.hi[(ii)] Minimum lot sizes

.hi[(iii)] Parking requirements

.hi[(iv)] Sidewalk and street size requirements

.hi[(v)] Height restrictions

--

Not all of these are bad things. But they do make developing land more expensive.

---
# Wharton Index

![](figures/wharton_new.png)


Higher values of the Wharton index $\implies$ tighter land use restrictions

# Example

# A Model

Do Land-Use regs and rent control interact? Absolutely! Let's model it

--

\begin{align*}
P(Q_d) &= 20 - 2*Q_d\\
P(Q_s) &= 8 + Q_s\\
\end{align*}

Compute the equilibrium. Graph it, if that is helpful

--

- Now suppose the government ratchets up land-use regs. New supply is given by:

\begin{align*}
P(Q_s^{new}) = 8 + 2*Q_s^{new}
\end{align*}

---
# Example

Old eq: $Q^* = 4$, $P^* = 12$

New eq: $Q^* = 3$, $P^* = 15$


Government comes in and says the rents are too high. Rent control set at $12$ per unit. Now you have:

\begin{align*}
12 = 8+2*Q_s \implies Q_s = 2
\end{align*}


---
count: false

\end{align*}

So we have a .pink[shortage] of two units at the .hi.purple[old] equilibrium price. `r emo::ji("anguished")`

---
# A Note

We wont have time (but it might be good practice) for you to think through what would happen if the market was a .hi[monopoly]
- Similar to the .hi.purple[monopsonist], rent control can actually .pink[lower prices] in a completely .purple[monopolized] housing market


Let's take a (quick) look at some recent empirical evidence

---
# Empirics

[Diamond et. al (2019)](https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/DMQ.pdf)
- 1979: Rent control in SF put in place for all standing buildings with 5 apartments or more
- New buildings exempt (to promote developers to continue building)
- Small multi-family apartment buildings ("mom & pop") exempted
- 1994: Exemption for small multi-family buildings removed. All apartments .hi[built before 1980] subject to rent control
    
  
---
# Empirics

In this study:

- .hi[Treatment:] Those living in small apartment complexes (5 or less) built in 1979 or before

- .hi[Control:] Those living in small apartments complexes (5 or less) built after 1979 (not subject to rent control)

--

A fair comparison? Maybe concerned that those living in apartments built before or after 1979 are systematically different.

.hi.slate[Main Findings]: 

.hi[(i)] Reduced renter mobility by ~20%

.hi[(ii)] Reduced housing supply by about 15%
