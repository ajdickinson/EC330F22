More than .hi[4 billion] people living in urban area globally <sup>.hi[†]</sup>

Urban populations are now greater than rural populations

# Paradox: Why do cities exist?

Urban population trends and technological innovations seem .hi[paradoxical]

The world is getting .hi[flatter], yet urban populations are .hi-red[booming]

This .hi[paradox] motivates the questions:

--

.center[.hi[Why have some cities succeeded?]]
  
--

.center[.hii[Why have some cities failed?]]

# PPF Heuristics

When looking at PPFs, to determine:


(i) .hi[AA]: Check intercepts
- Whoever has higher valued .hii[intercept] has the .hi[AA] in production


(ii) .hi[CA]: Check slopes
- A .hi[steeper slope] indicates CA on the vertical axis
- A .hii[shallower slope] indicates CA on the horizontal axis


---
# Why do cities exist?

We need land to produce food and resources; dense cities don't provide

--

Cities exist because of human .hi[technology] has created systems of production and trade that defy the natural order

Three conditions must be satisfied:

--

.hi[(i).] .hii[Agricultural surplus:] People outside cities must produce enough food to feed themselves and city dwellers

--

.hi[(ii).] .hii[Urban production:] City dwellers must produce goods or services to exchange for food grown by rural workers

--

.hi[(iii).] .hii[Transportation for exchange:] Efficient transportation system to facilitate the exchange of food and urban products must exist

--

The technology in this case is what we call .hi[trade]

# Backyard production model

---
# Backyard production model

A .hi[simple] economic model to understand the economic incentives of cities

--

Consider a region that produces and consumers two products:

- .hi[Bread]

- .hii[Shirts]

--

.center[.hi[Let's make three assumptions that would eliminate any incentives for households to geographically cluster]]

--

Relaxing each assumption will give us .hii[intuition] about the formation of cities


---
# Backyard production model

.hi[Model assumptions:]

--

.hi[A01:] There exist no differences in the productivity of land nor labor

  - No comparative advantages
  
--
  
.hi[A02:] Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) in .hi-blue[exchange] and .hi-green[transportation]

--

  - Per unit price to .hi[trade] goods _is the same_ no matter how much is traded 
  
  - No need for middle man firms to help with distribution
  
--

.hi[A03:] CRS in .hii[production]

--

  - The per unit price of production is constant
  
  - No economies of scale $\rightarrow$ households productivity = firm productivity

---
# Backyard production model

.hi[These three assumptions would eliminate exchange and ensure each household is self sufficient]

--

.hi[A01:] Equal productivity

.hi[A02:] CRS in exchange and transportation

.hi[A03:] CRS in production

--

<br>

There is no incentive to specialization due to .hi[transaction costs]<sup>.hi[†]</sup>

.footnote[<sup>.hi[†]</sup>transaction cost is the opportunity cost of the time required to exchange products]

Locational equilibrium would be .hi[uniformly distributed] population


---

# Backyard production model: Relax A01

.hi[Q]: Is all land and labor equally productive? 

--
 
.hi[A]: Nope. Let's relax that assumption
.hii[Ex:]
- Soil may be more productive in certain regions; better climate
- One region specializes in bread while the other in shirts

--

Relaxing A01 will lead to differences in productivity across cities:

$\implies$ .hi[comparative advantages]

$\implies$ specialization + trade

--

However, specialization and trade will not alone lead to urban growth
- Households are just as effective at trading as any firm


---
# Relax A02

In absence of scale economies, households trade directly<sup>.hi[†]</sup>

.footnote[
.hi[†] Scale economies: _bigger_ $\rightarrow$ _cheaper per unit_

]

--

- .hi[CRS in Exchange]: Implies households are just as efficient at executing trades as firms (no cost benefits to scaling)
- No reason to pay a firm to do so (and thus no reason to pay for density)

<br>

--

A trading firm will use productive inputs such as:

- Large truck for transportation

- Specialized workers

---


# Relax A02

To take full advantage advantage of scale economies firms locate s.t. they minimize costs of distribution

--

.center[.hi[ie. Build near river junctions, crossraods, ports]]

--
  
$\implies$ higher prices of land $\implies$ density

--

.hi[Result:] Trading cities 

<br>

--

These are represent the cities that .hi[existed before the industrial revolution]
- Most city workers did not produce goods but distributed them
- Trade was risky; insurance, credit, banking and legal services sprouted


---



name: factory
# Relax A03

Now relax the final assumption .hi[A03]

--

With economies of scale factories can outproduce households by lowering average costs
- Use indivisible inputs (machines)
- Allow workers to specialize

--

In order to pay for labor, a factory must pay such that they are indifferent between working in a factory and a rural area (.hi[A1.])

--

However, land scarcity .hi[binds] and rents near the factory begin to increase
- Wages increase due to .hi[locational equilibrium]

---
# Factory area

.hi[Example:]

Consider the shirt making factory:

  - .hi[Home] production: $20$  p shirt
  - .hi[Factory]:  $12$ p shirt (economies of scale)
  
--

The factory locates in a town with 50 miles to east and west of villages
  
   - 50 cents/mile to ship west.
   - 20 cents/mile to ship east
   
---
# Factory Towns

--

.hi[Market area:] Area over which factories underprice home production

--

Under what condition will a consumer purchase the shirt from a factory?

\begin{align*}
\underbrace{p_f}_\text{factory price} + \underbrace{t \times d}_\text{transit cost = cost p mile$\times$miles} \leq \underbrace{p_h}_\text{Home Price}
\end{align*}

--

.hi[Questions]:

1. Graph the cost of shirts throughout the entire region

2. Find the .hi[market area] of the town

--

  - Find the sum of the .hii[maximum distances] to the east and west that consumers will purchase the shirt from the factory

---

#Regional Costs

.hi[Home production:] 20 per shirt .hi[Factory production:] 12 per shirt

.hi[Transportation costs:] 50 cents/mile to ship west; 20 cents/mile east

#Market Area Calculation

Market area depends on which side we are looking at. Let $m$ denote miles

--

.hi[West:] Consumers buy from factory if

--
  
  $12 + .5*m_{west} \leq 20 \implies m_{west} \leq 16$
  
--

.hi[East:] Consumers buy from factory if 
  
  $12 + .2*m_{east} \leq 20 \implies m_{east} \leq 40$
  
--

.hi[Market area:]

--

$40+16 = 56$

---


# Factory Towns

1. Would workers rather live .hi.orange[closer] or .hi[further] from the factory?
  
--
  
  - .hi[Closer!]
    
--

2. What happens to land-prices .hi[close] to the factory?

--
  
  - They .hi[increase]
  
--

3. What happens to .hi[density]?

--

 - It will .hi[increase] 
 
--

__Result:__ Factory town!
