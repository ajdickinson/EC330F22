# Historical data
More than .hi[4 billion] people living in urban area globally &lt;sup&gt;.hi[†]&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

.footnote[ &lt;sup&gt;.hi[†]&lt;/sup&gt; Although the definition of an "urban area" is not exactly [well defined](https://blogs.worldbank.org/sustainablecities/what-does-urban-mean)]

--

Urban populations are now greater than rural populations
- Since .hi[2007]
- Only .hii[10%] of humans lived in urban areas in .hi[1800]
- Only .hii[1%] of land is categorize as urban area

&lt;br&gt;

# Paradox: Why do cities exist?

Urban population trends and technological innovations seem .hi[paradoxical]

--

The world is getting .hi[flatter], yet urban populations are .hi-red[booming]

--

This .hi[paradox] motivates the questions: 

&lt;br&gt;

--

.center[.h[Why do cities exist in the first place?]]

--

.center[.hi[Why have some cities succeeded?]]
  
--

.center[.hii[Why have some cities failed?]]
  
--

&lt;br&gt;

We will draw insights from economic models to answer these questions


---
# Paradox: Why do cities exist?

.hi[What do you think?]

There is a pretty simple, one-word answer. .hii[Any guesses?]

# Paradox: Why do cities exist?

.hi[What do you think?]

There is a pretty simple, one-word answer. .hii[Any guesses?]

&lt;br&gt;

.bigger[.center[.hi[Trade.]]]

.hi[Cities exist because individuals are not self-sufficient]

--

Suppose there was .hi[no trade]
- _What would we need for this to be true?_
- _Would this lead to no cities?_
- _Even with trade, when is it the case that households just trade amongst themselves?_

---

# EC 201 Review 017: Trade

.hi[Definitions:]

--

  - .hi[Absolute Advantage] (AA): An economic agent or entity has .hi-slate[AA] in exchange if they can produce more of the good in the same amount of time 
  
--
 
  - .hi[Comparative Advantage] (CA) : An economic agent or entity has .hi-slate[CA] in exchange if they can produce the good at a lower _oppurtunity cost_

--

- .hi[Production Possibilities Frontier] (PPF): All possible combinations of goods that an economic agent or entity can produce

---

# EC 201 Review 017: Trade - example

.hi[Example]: Suppose we have two countries, .hi[A] &amp; .hii[B], producing guns and oil
  
Each countries .hi[PPF] is described by:

- .hi[A:] `\(\color{#4c566a} {Guns_A = 10 - 2*Oil_A}\)`

- .hii[B:] `\(\color{#b48ead} {Guns_B = 20 - 5*Oil_B}\)`

&lt;br&gt;

--

.hi[(i)] Graph each countries .hi[PPF]

.hi[(ii)] Determine who has the AA and who has the CA in each good

---

# EC 201 Review 017: Trade - example

--

.hi[PPFs:]

&lt;img src="03-size_files/figure-html/ppf-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# EC 201 Review 017: Trade - example

.hi[PPFs:] 

&lt;img src="03-size_files/figure-html/ppf2-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

Whomever _gives up less_ to produce the same amount extra has the comparative advantage

---

# PPF Heuristics

When looking at PPFs, to determine:


(i) .hi[AA]: Check intercepts
- Whoever has higher valued .hii[intercept] has the .hi[AA] in production


(ii) .hi[CA]: Check slopes
- A .hi[steeper slope] indicates CA on the vertical axis
- A .hii[shallower slope] indicates CA on the horizontal axis


---
# Why do cities exist?

We need land to produce food and resources; dense cities don't provide

--

Cities exist because of human .hi[technology] has created systems of production and trade that defy the natural order

Three conditions must be satisfied:

--

.hi[(i).] .hii[Agricultural surplus:] People outside cities must produce enough food to feed themselves and city dwellers

--

.hi[(ii).] .hii[Urban production:] City dwellers must produce goods or services to exchange for food grown by rural workers

--

.hi[(iii).] .hii[Transportation for exchange:] Efficient transportation system to facilitate the exchange of food and urban products must exist

--

The technology in this case is what we call .hi[trade]

---

class: inverse, middle
# Backyard production model

---
# Backyard production model

A .hi[simple] economic model to understand the economic incentives of cities

--

Consider a region that produces and consumers two products:

- .hi[Bread]

- .hii[Shirts]

--

.center[.hi[Let's make three assumptions that would eliminate any incentives for households to geographically cluster]]

--

Relaxing each assumption will give us .hii[intuition] about the formation of cities


---
# Backyard production model

.hi[Model assumptions:]

--

.hi[A01:] There exist no differences in the productivity of land nor labor

  - No comparative advantages
  
--
  
.hi[A02:] Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) in .hi-blue[exchange] and .hi-green[transportation]

--

  - Per unit price to .hi[trade] goods _is the same_ no matter how much is traded 
  
  - No need for middle man firms to help with distribution
  
--

.hi[A03:] CRS in .hii[production]

--

  - The per unit price of production is constant
  
  - No economies of scale `\(\rightarrow\)` households productivity = firm productivity

---
# Backyard production model

.hi[These three assumptions would eliminate exchange and ensure each household is self sufficient]

--

.hi[A01:] Equal productivity

.hi[A02:] CRS in exchange and transportation

.hi[A03:] CRS in production

--

&lt;br&gt;

There is no incentive to specialization due to .hi[transaction costs]&lt;sup&gt;.hi[†]&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;.hi[†]&lt;/sup&gt;transaction cost is the opportunity cost of the time required to exchange products]

Locational equilibrium would be .hi[uniformly distributed] population


---

# Backyard production model: Relax A01

.hi[Q]: Is all land and labor equally productive? 

--
 
.hi[A]: Nope. Let's relax that assumption
.hii[Ex:]
- Soil may be more productive in certain regions; better climate
- One region specializes in bread while the other in shirts

--

Relaxing A01 will lead to differences in productivity across cities:

`\(\implies\)` .hi[comparative advantages]

`\(\implies\)` specialization + trade

--

However, specialization and trade will not alone lead to urban growth
- Households are just as effective at trading as any firm


---
# Relax A02

In absence of scale economies, households trade directly&lt;sup&gt;.hi[†]&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[
.hi[†] Scale economies: _bigger_ `\(\rightarrow\)` _cheaper per unit_

]

--

- .hi[CRS in Exchange]: Implies households are just as efficient at executing trades as firms (no cost benefits to scaling)
- No reason to pay a firm to do so (and thus no reason to pay for density)

&lt;br&gt;

--

A trading firm will use productive inputs such as:

- Large truck for transportation

- Specialized workers

---


# Relax A02

To take full advantage advantage of scale economies firms locate s.t. they minimize costs of distribution

--

.center[.hi[ie. Build near river junctions, crossraods, ports]]

--
  
`\(\implies\)` higher prices of land `\(\implies\)` density

--

.hi[Result:] Trading cities 

&lt;br&gt;

--

These are represent the cities that .hi[existed before the industrial revolution]
- Most city workers did not produce goods but distributed them
- Trade was risky; insurance, credit, banking and legal services sprouted


---



name: factory
# Relax A03

Now relax the final assumption .hi[A03]

--

With economies of scale factories can outproduce households by lowering average costs
- Use indivisible inputs (machines)
- Allow workers to specialize

--

In order to pay for labor, a factory must pay such that they are indifferent between working in a factory and a rural area (.hi[A1.])

--

However, land scarcity .hi[binds] and rents near the factory begin to increase
- Wages increase due to .hi[locational equilibrium]

---
# Factory area

.hi[Example:]

Consider the shirt making factory:

  - .hi[Home] production: `\(20\)`  p shirt
  - .hi[Factory]:  `\(12\)` p shirt (economies of scale)
  
--

The factory locates in a town with 50 miles to east and west of villages
  
   - 50 cents/mile to ship west.
   - 20 cents/mile to ship east
   
---
# Factory Towns

--

.hi[Market area:] Area over which factories underprice home production

--

Under what condition will a consumer purchase the shirt from a factory?

`\begin{align*}
\underbrace{p_f}_\text{factory price} + \underbrace{t \times d}_\text{transit cost = cost p mile$\times$miles} \leq \underbrace{p_h}_\text{Home Price}
\end{align*}`

--

.hi[Questions]:

1. Graph the cost of shirts throughout the entire region

2. Find the .hi[market area] of the town

--

  - Find the sum of the .hii[maximum distances] to the east and west that consumers will purchase the shirt from the factory

---

#Regional Costs

.hi[Home production:] 20 per shirt .hi[Factory production:] 12 per shirt

.hi[Transportation costs:] 50 cents/mile to ship west; 20 cents/mile east

--

&lt;img src="03-size_files/figure-html/factory_town-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
#Market Area Calculation

Market area depends on which side we are looking at. Let `\(m\)` denote miles

--

.hi[West:] Consumers buy from factory if

--
  
  `\(12 + .5*m_{west} \leq 20 \implies m_{west} \leq 16\)`
  
--

.hi[East:] Consumers buy from factory if 
  
  `\(12 + .2*m_{east} \leq 20 \implies m_{east} \leq 40\)`
  
--

.hi[Market area:]

--

`\(40+16 = 56\)`

---


# Factory Towns

1. Would workers rather live .hi.orange[closer] or .hi[further] from the factory?
  
--
  
  - .hi[Closer!]
    
--

2. What happens to land-prices .hi[close] to the factory?

--
  
  - They .hi[increase]
  
--

3. What happens to .hi[density]?

--

 - It will .hi[increase] 
 
--

__Result:__ Factory town!
