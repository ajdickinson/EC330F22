# Introduction to neighborhood choice

We have a fairly simple model of .hi[residential choice] (rental prices)

--

.hi[Q:] What factor(s) in the model determine housing demand?

--

.hi[A:] Bid-Rent model assumes commuting costs are the .hii[only factor]
- this .hi[unreasonable] assumption isolates particular economic factors

--

_What factors influence neighborhood decision choices?_

--

.hi-blue[Examples:]

--

.pull-left[
- Schools
- Demographics
- Tax rates]
.pull-right[
- Public safety
- Air quality
- Natural beauty]

---
# Neighborhood choice: Amenities

.hi[Definition:] .hii[Amenity] 

An _amenity_ is a .hi[location-specific] consumption good

--

.pull-left[
- Beaches
- Weather
- Public transport]
.pull-right[
- Parks
- Restaurants
- Recreation]

--

Different types of .hii[amenities]
- Some are nonrival<sup>.hii[†]</sup>: Theaters, public transport 
- Some are nonexcludable<sup>.hii[††]</sup>: Parks
- Some are both nonrival and nonexcludable: National defense, sports teams, fireworks

.footnote[.hii[†] Nonrival goods: Accessible by all; usage does limit subsequent use <br> .hii[††] Nonexcludable goods: Impossible to exclude other from consuming]

---
# Neighborhood choice: Amenities

.hi[Two more refined definitions:]

.hi[(i) Exogenous Amenities:] Location-specific consumption good that exist .hi-red[are not] influenced by where people decide to live

--

  - .hi[Exogenous:] "Determined outside of the model" (fall from the sky)
    
  - Weather, geographic characteristics

--

.hi[(ii)] .hii[Endogenous Amenities:] Location-specific consumption goods that .hi-blue[are] influenced by location decisions of individuals

--

  - .hii[Endogenous:] "Determined within the model"
  
  - School quality, crime, pollution

---
# Neighborhood choice: Amenities

To determine whether or not an amenity is .hi[exogenous] (.hii[endogenous]):

--

.center[_"Will choosing to live here impact the amenity?"_]

<br>

--

  - .hi[Exogenous] _Beaches exist regardless whether people live near by_
 
--

  - .hii[Endogenous] _Crime is a function of the individuals in the area_
  
--

<br>

Questions regarding differences between .hi[EXOGENOUS] and .hii[ENDOGENOUS?]

---
# Neighborhood choice

Previously we explored (broadly) a cities shape
- modeled where different sectors of the economy choose to locate

But we made an assumption that everyone was the .hi[same]

--

<br>

_Why are city neighborhoods so .hi[heterogeneous]?_

--

_What economics factor influence .hi[neighborhood sorting] within a city?_

<br>

--

Model this .hi[heterogeneity] by considering a public good: .hii[Public parks]


---
class: inverse, middle
# Neighborhood choice + Sorting for public goods


---
# Demand for public goods

.hi[Consider a simple sorting model for a single, non-rival public good]

--

Model a three-person city with one public good: .hi-blue[Public park]

- Cost .hi[$60 per acre] to build

- Cost is shared equally across all three citizens: .hi-blue[$20 per acre] each

--

Of the three citizen, demand for the park varies:

--

- Low demand: $\text{Lyla}: \color{#4c566a} {P = 30 - 2*\text{acres}}$

- Mid demand: $\text{Gracie}: \color{#b48ead}{P = 40 -2*\text{acres}}$

- High demand: $\text{Cooper}: \color{#bf616a} {P = 50 -2*\text{acres}}$

--

Together they must .hi[vote] for one park size in a binary election

---
# Demand for public goods

```{R, inc_plot, echo=F,fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, dev = "svg", cache=T}



cooper <- function(x) 50 - 2*x
gracie <- function(x) 40 - 2*x
lyla <- function(x) 30 - 2*x
tax <- function(x) 20

ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0, 20)), aes(x)) + 
  stat_function(fun= lyla, col = blue, size = 1.5) +
  stat_function(fun = gracie, col = purple, size = 1.5) +

  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(x = "acres", y = "Price (WTP)") +
  mytheme 

```

--

For each citizen, optimal park size is found when $MB_{park} = MC_{park}$

If a first past the post election system is used, who wins their preferred park size? Who loses?

# Demand for public goods: Majority rule

Gracie is the .hii[median voter]

  - Splits the voting public in half

---
# Alternative to majority rule

Majority rule always leave two citizens unhappy: .hi-red[Cooper] and .hi[Lyla]

--

Suppose an _alternative_ is to form new municipalities

<br>

--

Consider a new metropolitan area with .hii[3] municipalities with 3 citizen
- Each district votes on their own park
- Each citizen knowns each other's preferences

--

.hii[Key assumption:] Citizens pick which municipality to live in

--

Implication: Similar types sort into the same neighborhood

--

.pull-left[
- Lylaville: 5 acre park
- Gracity: 10 acre park]
.pull-right[
- Cooperstown: 15 acre park]

---
# Alternative to majority rule

By .hi[voting with their feet] each citizen sorts themselves into homogenous communities with their preferred public good allocation (park size)

.hi[Now our city has three neighborhoods with homogenous types]

- Accomodates diversity in demand

--

.center[.hi[Is reality this simple?]]

--

.center[.hii[Nope]]

--

.hi[Let's add another layer of complexity:] .hii[Taxes]

---
# Alternative: Property tax

Up to this point, funding for the park is financed with a .hi[head tax]

--

More realistic to model neighborhood sorting using .hi[property taxes]

--

- Allow for variation in preferences + property values:

  - The higher your property value, the more taxes you pay for the park
    - $\tau = PV * 10$
  - .hi[3] different property values: 2, 10, 24
  - .hi[9] combos: Low-Low, Low-Mid, Low-High, Mid-Low...High-High
  
--

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibb <- tibble(
  Outcome = c("Mixed municipality", "Exclusive small PV", "Exclusive mid PV", "Exclusive big PV"),
  Tax_rate = c("$10", "$60", "$12", "$5"),
  small = c("$20", "$120", "-", "-"),
  mid = c("$100", "-", "$120", "-"),
  big = c("$240", "-", "-", "$120")
)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibb %>% kable(
  col.names = c("Outcome", "Tax rate per dollar in PV", "Small PV", "Mid PV", "Big PV"),
  align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "c")

Citizen of PV similar type have incentive to sort together to reduce tax

# Eq Defn

Explicitly, an .hi[equilibrium] in this model is a point at which the rent premium is in balance across both groups

--

This always holds when the rent premium curves intersect
  - May also occur when the do not (full segregation)
  
--

If there is a maximum number of lots in a neighborhood then-

- If the $RP$ for the group listed on the axis is _.hi[higher]_ then this will also be an equilibrium because .hi[there is no tendency for change]

- If the $RP$ for the group listed on the axis is _.hii[lower]_ then population dynamics move away from this point

--

---
# Stable vs Unstable Eq

An equilibrium is .hi[stable] if a small movement away will encounter self - .hi[correcting] forces

--

- An equilibrium is stable if when you move away from it, the pop. dynamics push you back to where you came from
  - Physical ex: Funnel

--

A equilibrium is .hii[unstable] if a small movement away will encounter self - .hii[reinforcing] forces

--

- That is, an equilibrium is unstable if when you move away from it, the population dynamics push you even farther than where you came from

# A Heuristic

1) Draw a vertical dashed line at every intersection point

2) For every region between the vertical dashed lines, it must be the case that one of the rent premium curves is above the other

  - If the rent prem curve for the group listed on the axis is .hi[higher], then this group will increase in number. Draw rightward arrows on the axis
  
  - If the rent prem curve for the group listed on the axis is .hii[lower], then this group will decrease in number. Draw leftward arrows


---
# A Heuristic

3) If there are rightward arrows pushing toward 100% in one nbhd, then 100% (complete segregation) is an eq even if the rent prem curves do not intersect there

4) For every eq. value, look at its immediate vicinity

  - If there are arrows moving towards it, it is a .hi[stable eq]
  
  - If there are arrows moving away from it on one or both sides, it is a .hi[unstable eq]

# Neighborhood Sorting


.hi[Externalities] for kids:

  - Good/bad role models as adults
  
  - Classmates in school: focused vs disruptive


--

.hi[Externalities] for adults:

  - Positive: job information, property valuation
  
  - Negative: property values 

--

In general: positive externalities increase with income and education level. Why?

---
# Neighborhood Sorting

These externalities give rise to the following questions:

1. Who gets desirable neighbors?

--

2. Will there be segregated or integrated neighborhoods?

--

3. Will there be sorting or mixing with respect to income, age, race, or some combination of those factors?

  - Is this sorting _de jure_, _de facto_, or both? More on this next time

--

4. What are the implications for the price of land in various neighborhoods?
